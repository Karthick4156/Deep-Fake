# Deep Fake Image Detection

## What's This About?
Welcome to our deep fake image detection project! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è With the rise of deep fake technology, distinguishing between real and fake images has become quite a challenge. But worry not! Our project is here to the rescue. We've developed some nifty machine learning techniques to help identify those sneaky deep fakes.

## Cool Stuff We Offer
- **Fancy Deep Learning Models**: We've got some serious neural networks to detect deep fake images.
- **Pre-processing Magic**: Scripts to prep your images, making them ready for detection.
- **Evaluation Goodies**: Tools to measure how well our models are doing.
- **Easy Peasy Interface**: A command-line interface that even your grandma could use to spot deep fakes in images or videos.

## What You Need
- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Let's Get Started!
1. **Clone this Repository**: Just hit that green button and grab our code.
2. **Install Dependencies**: A quick `pip install -r requirements.txt` will do the trick.
3. **Get Those Models**: Unfortunately, we can't provide the pre-trained models in this repository. You can either train your own models using our scripts or find pre-trained models from other sources. 

## How to Use
1. **Train a Model**: Train one of our deep learning models on your dataset of real and fake images.
2. **Evaluate Performance**: Check how well your model is doing with our evaluation scripts.
3. **Spot the Fakes**: Use our command-line interface to catch those pesky deep fakes in action!
