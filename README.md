# Deep Fake Image Detection 

## Overview
Welcome to our deep fake image detection project! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This project utilizes machine learning techniques to detect deep fake images and provides a user-friendly web interface powered by Flask.

## Features
- Deep learning models for detecting deep fake images.
- Integration with Flask for a web-based interface.
- Pre-processing scripts for image data augmentation and normalization.
- Evaluation scripts for assessing model performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/deep-fake-detection.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Flask application:

```
python app.py
```

4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the deep fake image detection interface.

## Usage
1. Upload an image to the web interface.
2. Click on the "Detect" button to analyze the image for deep fake content.
3. View the results indicating whether the image is real or a deep fake.
